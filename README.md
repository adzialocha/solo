'Solo' [SLP016] is the Slip debut of Berlin-based Andreas Dzialocha. Lilting electric bass melodies are refracted through a tangled network of live computer processing. Solo‘s ruptured nocturnes are intimate duets between instrument and machine, with Dzialocha eloquently responding to randomised pulsing reverbs, filters, and compressors, which snatch his delicate motifs into virtual space in real time.

Andreas studied art history, musicology, and computer science, and is founder and director of Berlin-based Serenus Zeitblom Oktett, and upstart publishing platform BLATT 3000.

'Solo' is available in a limited tape run, housed in a filter-foam case designed by Susie Whaites, and accompanied by a tracing-paper poster and insert artwork by Rian Treanor.
