# Solo [SLP016]

```
'Solo' [SLP016] is the Slip debut of Berlin-based Andreas
Dzialocha.Lilting electric bass melodies are refracted through a tangled
network of live computer processing. Soloâ€˜s ruptured nocturnes are
intimate duets between instrument and machine, with Dzialocha eloquently
responding to randomised pulsing reverbs, filters, and compressors,
which snatch his delicate motifs into virtual space in real time.

Andreas studied art history, musicology, and computer science, and is
founder and director of Berlin-based Serenus Zeitblom Oktett, and
upstart publishing platform BLATT 3000.

'Solo' is available in a limited tape run, housed in a filter-foam case
designed by Susie Whaites, and accompanied by a tracing-paper poster and
insert artwork by Rian Treanor.
